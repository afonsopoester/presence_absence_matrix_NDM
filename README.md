# presence_absence_matrix_NDM

This is quick python code using Pandas that can be used along the biogeography software NDM/VNDM to generate a presence absence matrix of the resulting consensus areas from multiple analysis

Thus, one can make multiple analysis with NDM/VNDM and then generate this matrix to analyse it with a UPGMA as a metaconsensus criterion.
